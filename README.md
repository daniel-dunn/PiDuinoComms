# PiDuinoComms
A refresher project on Arduino and Python on the Raspberry Pi, the goal is to display hardware changes made on the Arduino on a GUI on the PI.

Skills/Principles Used

- Hardware Input Detection
- Serial Communication
- GUI Programming
- Multithreading

In the current version, I have used a asynchonous call to the inbound Serial comms from the Arduino board and display it in a
tkinters label.

Points for extention could be the continuos print into a textbox to act as a serial montitor with an option to save to a
text file.
