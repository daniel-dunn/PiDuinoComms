# PiDuinoComms
A refresher project on Arduino and Python on the Raspberry Pi, the goal is to display hardware changes made on the Arduino on a GUI on the PI.

Skills/Principles Used

- Hardware Input Detection
- Serial Communication
- GUI Programming
- File I/O
- Multithreading

In the current version, I have used a asynchonous call to the inbound Serial comms from the Arduino board and display it in a
tkinters scrollable text area. There are also buttons enabling the window to be cleared or the contents saved to a file.
